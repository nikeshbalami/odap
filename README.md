# Open Data Awareness Program
Open Data Awareness Program (ODAP) aims to raise awareness about the concept and usage of open data to Nepalâ€™s digital natives, who are the current youth population and the potential future decision-makers and leaders of Nepal. As a part of the program, hands-on training sessions are being organized at different colleges and youth organizations, where participants will be provided with a compiled Open Data Manual to aid their understanding on open data. After the conclusion of the all the workshops at different colleges, a hackathon event will be organized in Kathmandu to bring together selected participants from colleges and youth organizations where the training sessions were held to work collaboratively on opening up data currently in closed format. At the hackathon event, the participants will share their experiences of learning and working with open data, and will discuss on ways to engage more young people in the open data movement in Nepal.
